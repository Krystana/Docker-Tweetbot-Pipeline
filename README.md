my projects

In my repositories you can have a look at the projects I realised so far. 

I just started coding recently and in the moment I am attending the SPICED ACADEMY Data Science Bootcamp --> https://www.spiced-academy.com/en/program/data-science.

So far all the code you can see here was produced in the context of the 12-weeks-bootcamp:

- week 4   -  text analysis: 

building models to predict the artist by a piece of text, using webscraping, HTML parsing, bag-of-words-method, Scikitlearn pipeline &
writing a command line interface for making predictions on that.
           
- week 5   -  creating a dashboard:

using a postgres database and metabase on cloud servers. 

- week 6   - docker compose pipeline:

using Twitter API, mongodb, postgresdb to run a slackbot in docker compose. 
        
        
        
The projects of week 1-3 will follow, just like the upcoming ones.
